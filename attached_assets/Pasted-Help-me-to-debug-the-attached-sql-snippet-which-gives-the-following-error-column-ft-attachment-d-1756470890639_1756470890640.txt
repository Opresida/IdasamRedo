Debugging “column ft.attachment does not exist”

When PostgreSQL reports column ft.attachment does not exist it means that the table (or sub‑query) referenced by the alias ft does not contain a column named attachment at the point where the SELECT list (or a later clause) is evaluated. Below are the most common causes and the steps you can take to resolve the error.

1. Verify the Table/CTE that ft Refers To
Locate the definition of ft – it will be either:

a real table (FROM files ft),
a view (FROM public.file_view ft), or
a CTE/sub‑query (WITH ft AS ( … )).
Inspect its columns:

SQL Query



SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = '<schema_of_ft>'
  AND table_name   = '<real_name_of_ft>';

Replace <schema_of_ft>/<real_name_of_ft> with the actual schema/table name that ft resolves to. If ft is a CTE, run the CTE alone (or EXPLAIN) to see the column list it returns.

Typical mismatches

The column is actually called attachments, attachment_url, attachment_id, etc.
The column exists in a related table (e.g., file_attachments) but not in ft.
A recent migration renamed or dropped the column.
2. Check for Typos or Alias Shadowing
Issue	What to Look For	Fix
Misspelling	ft.attachment vs. ft.attachments or ft.attachment_url	Correct the column name.
Wrong alias	ft may have been re‑aliased later in a JOIN (e.g., JOIN files f ON … and later SELECT ft.attachment)	Use the correct alias (f.attachment) or keep the original alias consistent.
CTE column list mismatch	WITH ft(col1, col2) AS (SELECT …) but the SELECT inside the CTE does not output a column named attachment.	Add the missing column to the CTE’s SELECT or change the external reference.
3. Add the Missing Column (If It Should Exist)
If the column truly belongs to that table and was accidentally removed:

SQL Query



ALTER TABLE <schema>.<real_table_name>
ADD COLUMN attachment <appropriate_type>;

Choose the correct data type (e.g., text, uuid, jsonb, or a foreign‑key reference). After adding, re‑run the original query.

4. Use the Correct Table/Join
Often the desired column lives in a related table. Example pattern:

SQL Query



FROM files ft
LEFT JOIN file_attachments fa ON fa.file_id = ft.id

In this case you would reference fa.attachment (or fa.url, etc.) instead of ft.attachment.

5. Quick “What‑Am‑I‑Missing?” Query
Run the following (adjust the schema/table name) to see all columns for the object you think ft is:

SQL Query



SELECT *
FROM <schema>.<table_name>  -- replace with the actual table name
LIMIT 0;                     -- returns column metadata only

If the column list does not include attachment, you’ve identified the root cause.

6. Example Walk‑through
Assume the problematic part of your query looks like this (line 62 highlighted):

SQL Query



SELECT
    ft.id,
    ft.title,
    ft.created_at,
    ft.attachment,          -- ← error here
    u.email
FROM file_tracks ft
JOIN users u ON u.id = ft.owner_id;

Steps
Inspect file_tracks:

SQL Query



SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'file_tracks';

If the result set shows id, title, created_at, owner_id … no attachment, then:

Check related table: maybe file_attachments holds the file data.

SQL Query



SELECT *
FROM file_attachments
WHERE file_id = <some_id>;

Update query:

SQL Query



SELECT
    ft.id,
    ft.title,
    ft.created_at,
    fa.attachment,          -- use the correct alias
    u.email
FROM file_tracks ft
LEFT JOIN file_attachments fa ON fa.file_id = ft.id
JOIN users u ON u.id = ft.owner_id;

Or add the column (if it truly belongs to file_tracks):

SQL Query



ALTER TABLE file_tracks
ADD COLUMN attachment text;   -- pick appropriate type

7. Checklist to Resolve the Error
 Identify the exact table/CTE that ft refers to.
 Verify the column list for that object.
 Correct any typo in the column name.
 Ensure you are using the right alias (no shadowing).
 If the column belongs elsewhere, join the appropriate table and reference its alias.
 If the column should exist but is missing, add it with ALTER TABLE.
What to Do Next
Run the inspection query (replace placeholders) and share the column list you get.
Tell me whether attachment belongs to a different table or should be added to the current one.
If you have the full SQL snippet, paste it here, and I can point out the exact spot to modify.
Once we have that information we can produce the exact revised query or DDL needed. Feel free to provide the table definitions or the complete query, and we’ll get it fixed in one step.
